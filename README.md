### Insertion Sort

#### Uses two for loops: one that iterates through the group sizes needs to be checked, one that iterates through the group being sorted. For the sake of experiment, I used the sort by gap and set the gap to 1. This is to ensure that the sorting algorithms donâ€™t have different comparisons. The insertion sort swaps every valid check.
